# Busbar Contact Resistance Research  
**Astronics AES – Summer 2024 Internship**

## Objective
Investigate how **bolt stack-up configurations**, **torque specifications**, and **bolt orientations** influence the **electrical contact resistance** in busbar connections. The goal was to optimize busbar connection design to **minimize heat generation** in low-pressure aerospace environments.

## Context
Electronic systems aboard aircraft must operate reliably at **high altitudes**, where **air pressure is low** and **convection is limited**. In such environments, **heat generated from contact resistance** becomes a critical design concern. 

## Key Research Questions
- How does **bolt torque** affect contact resistance?
- What is the role of **bolt stack-up order** (flat washer, Belleville washer, busbar layer sequence)?
- How does **bolt orientation** (vertical vs horizontal) change resistance characteristics?
- Can mechanical standardization improve electrical consistency?

## Methods
- Designed and assembled controlled test rigs replicating real-world busbar configurations
- Used a **4-wire Kelvin measurement** method to accurately capture milliohm-level resistance
- Conducted experiments at multiple torque levels and stack-up configurations for varying samples and materials
- Recorded trends in resistance vs. mechanical assembly and material

## Results Summary
> _Plots and images coming soon._  
> _Add `resistance-vs-torque-plot.png` or `test-fixture-diagram.png` here once available._

- Increasing bolt torque consistently lowered resistance until plateau
- Certain washer configurations reduced variability between tests
- Vertical bolt orientations showed slightly higher variability in resistance
- Identified an optimal torque and stack-up spec to be standardized across future programs

## Outcome
Recommendations from this research were integrated into new design guidelines used by multiple aerospace programs at Astronics AES to improve the thermal performance of power distribution systems at altitude.
