# Ethan-Engineering-Portfolio
Hi! Iâ€™m a mechanical engineering student at the University of Alabama with a passion for aerospace systems, CAD design, simulation, and embedded hardware.

This portfolio highlights some of my engineering projects across FEA, CFD, design, fabrication, and controls.

Thank you for your patience as this portfolio is actively under development and only a small portion of my projects have been effectively formatted for public viewing as of right now. I am working hard to make the rest of my projects available for display soon!
